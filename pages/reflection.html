      <h1>Closing Remarks</h1>
      <p>
        Creating this portfolio was both a personal and creative journey. While I haven‚Äôt physically traveled far,
        building these pieces allowed me to explore the world through memory, imagination, and emotional resonance.
        From fictional narratives to poetic reflections, each section served as a way to reimagine what it means
        to witness a place and not just by going there, but by feeling it deeply.
      </p>

        My goal was to show that travel is not only about location, but also about presence and intention. I focused on
        themes of home, cultural memory, food, and belonging which were often drawn from family stories, imagined destinations,
        and sensory details. Whether through the poetry of Paris or the food of Oaxaca, each piece represents a kind
        of emotional travel.

        The project taught me to slow down and look closer‚Äîat artworks, street corners, rituals, and my own memories.
        More importantly, it helped me realize that meaningful journeys can begin right here, from within. I hope
        that readers of this collection leave with a sense of wonder, openness, and the desire to travel with more
        purpose and heart.
