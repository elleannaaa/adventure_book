    <h1>Eating the Soul of the Place</h1>

    <p><em>Food isn’t just something we eat; it’s a language of memory and a way to witness the soul of a place.</em></p>

      <p>
        My mother missed the taste of home,<br>
        Oaxaca lived quietly in her bones.<br>
        She found it in a quiet corner<br>
        where walls were painted with memory.<br><br>

        She ordered mole, tamales, dreams,<br>
        then pointed at something near the bottom.<br>
        “Chapulines,” she smiled,<br>
        and I felt my courage shrink.<br><br>

        Crunchy legs with chili lime<br>
        stared back like tiny dares.<br>
        She popped one into her mouth<br>
        while her eyes lit up with joy.<br><br>

        I followed, breath caught,<br>
        teeth meeting roasted spice.<br>
        The flavor was oddly warm—<br>
        like peanuts, like fear, like trust.<br><br>

        The second bite came easier.<br>
        Somewhere between lime and toasted corn,<br>
        I tasted the place she came from.<br>
        This was not just food.<br><br>

        It was a story<br>
        served on a ceramic plate,<br>
        a memory folded in masa,<br>
        a conversation I never knew I needed.<br><br>

        Now, when I think of travel,<br>
        I think of meals that carry memory,<br>
        of flavors that speak in unfamiliar tones,<br>
        and the quiet bravery it takes to listen.
