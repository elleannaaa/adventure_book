      <h1>Dear Future Me, Somewhere Out There...</h1>

      <p>
        I’m not someone who has traveled far and wide yet. When I think about going somewhere new, I worry I won’t know what to do. 
        I don’t want to leave a place feeling regretful, like I missed something meaningful or forgot to document what it made me feel. 
        So I’ve created this little checklist, a personal travel manifesto, to keep me grounded and intentional. 
        These are some key aspects I want to explore should I ever get the chance to travel. My hope is to leave each place with no regrets, only memories.
      </p>

      <h2>My Travel Manifesto</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I will research local cultures and customs before I go, and remain respectful to them while I’m there.</li>
  <li>I will try local food with curiosity, using it as a way to connect with the place and its people.</li>
  <li>I will jot down my feelings and emotional reactions in real time while I’m still in the place, not just after.</li>
  <li>I will learn the history of the places I visit, not just take pictures of the beautiful parts.</li>
  <li>I will collect one meaningful token or keepsake from every place I visit as a way to remember it deeply.</li>
  <li>I will capture my journey through art and poetry whether it’s a haiku, a sketch, or a metaphor—so the emotional landscape doesn’t fade over time.</li>
</ul>

      <p>
        This manifesto isn’t about doing travel “right”;it’s about being honest, present, and intentional. 
        I want to travel in a way that honors where I am and who I’m becoming. Wherever I go, may I stay open, grounded, and grateful.
